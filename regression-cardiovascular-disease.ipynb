Introduction\n","\n","The World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.\n","\n","**Goal:** <br>\n","The goal is to whether patient have 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD or not.\n","\n","**Data source:**<br>\n","The dataset is publically available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christofel04/cardiovascular-study-dataset-predict-heart-disea/data) and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patients‚Äô information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.\n","\n","**Variables:**<br>\n","- **age:** patient age<br>\n","- **education:** Some high school (1), high school/GED (2), some college/vocational school (3), college (4)<br>\n","- **sex:** male (M), female (F)<br>\n","- **is_smoking:** whether or not the patient is a current smoker (\"YES\" or \"NO\")<br>\n","- **cigsPerDay:** the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day (can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)<br>\n","- **BPMeds:** whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (nominal)<br>\n","- **prevalentStroke:** whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (nominal)<br>\n","- **prevalentHyp:** whether or not the patient was hypertensive (nominal)<br>\n","- **diabetes:** whether or not the patient had diabetes (nominal)<br>\n","- **totChol:** total cholesterol level (continuous)<br>\n","- **sysBP:** systolic blood pressure (continuous)<br>\n","- **diaBP:** diastolic blood pressure (continuous)<br>\n","- **BMI:** Body Mass Index (continuous)<br>\n","- **heartRate:** heart rate (continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)<br>\n","- **glucose:** glucose level (continuous)<br>\n","- **TenYearCHD:** predict variable; 10-xear risk of coronary heart disease CHD; binary: ‚Äú1‚Äù, means ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, ‚Äú0‚Äù means ‚ÄúNo‚Äù\n","\n","\n","**Project outline:**<br>\n","1.

We mostly care about finding all true positive cases which recall is the best metric for. On the flipside, this means we have to compromise on other metrics such as overall accuracy and precision. \n","\n","The outcome and prediction power of this model depends on what it actually will be used for. If the model is used to simply recommend patients to start a preventitive program based on their heart disease risk, 89% recall may be good enough. If it is used for something else where the stakes of being wrong are higher, this may not be good enough and we'd need to further improve the model.
