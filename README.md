# Project: Logistic Regression - Cardiovascular Disease Prediction


--------------------------------------------
## Project Objective

Goal of this project was to fit a logistic regression model to a patient dataset in order to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). 

**Tools used:**
Python in Jupyter Notebook

**Data source:**
The dataset is publically available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christofel04/cardiovascular-study-dataset-predict-heart-disea/data) and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

**Project outline:**
1. Introduction
2. Data loading & cleaning
3. EDA 
4. Modelling
